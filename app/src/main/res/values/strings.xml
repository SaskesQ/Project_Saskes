    <string name="paragraph">The goal of the players in checkers is to cut down all of the opponents
         checkers or create such a situation that the opponent has no more moves.\n\n
         Checkers are played sequentially, one move at a time on black squares. The game is started
         by <b>whites</b> (<i>unless otherwise agreed upon</i>) and goes <b>only diagonally</b>,
         one square at a time (this is how ordinary checkers, not turned into queens, walk).\n\n
         The opponents checker is cut by jumping over it, the cut is mandatory and can only be done
         forward(<i>depending on the set rules of the game</i>).\n\n
         <b>several crossings</b> can be done during one move, if after jumping over a checker you
         end up in a square next to another crossed checker. A checker that has reached the end line
         ("Kings row") turns into a queen, which is given additional powers - it can walk back and
         forth one square at a time (also depending on the set rules of the game). \n\n A checker
         can also turn into a queen during crossing, if it is on the end line during one of the crossing stages.</string>
    <string name="history_paragraph">While the oldest known <b>Checkers</b>artifact unearthed in Iraq dates back to 3000 BC, the earliest known version of the game comes from a game called <b>Alquerque</b>, which was played in ancient Egypt in 1400 BC. After years of being played the Egyptian way, in <b> 1100 AD</b>, a Frenchman adapted it to be played on a Chessboard with 12 pieces per player.
        Then, in 1756 an English mathematician created official rules for the game, and in <b>1840</b> was the start of the very first <b>World Championships</b>. <b>Arthur Samuel </b> then created a computerized Checkers program in 1952, which helped turn Checkers into the global phenomenon it is today. In 2007, the game was <b>“solved”</b> by a team of researchers from the University of Alberta (in Canada) led by <b>Jonathan Schaeffer</b>.
        As you can see, there is not too much depth to the history of Checkers. Who officially created the first version of <b>Checkers</b> is unknown, and even though the oldest Checkers artifact found dates back to 3000 BC, was it perhaps based on a game that has even older origins? There are many unanswered questions when it comes to the history of Checkers.
That being said, the history of Checkers is somewhat vague in that no one truly knows its exact origins. There are various ancient games that have a similar concept, and so the history of the game is not quite precise.</string>
