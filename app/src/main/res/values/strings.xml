    <string name="paragraph">The goal of the players in checkers is to cut down all of the opponents
         checkers or create such a situation that the opponent has no more moves.\n\n
         Checkers are played sequentially, one move at a time on black squares. The game is started
         by <b>whites</b> (<i>unless otherwise agreed upon</i>) and goes <b>only diagonally</b>,
         one square at a time (this is how ordinary checkers, not turned into queens, walk).\n\n
         The opponents checker is cut by jumping over it, the cut is mandatory and can only be done
         forward(<i>depending on the set rules of the game</i>).\n\n
         <b>several crossings</b> can be done during one move, if after jumping over a checker you
         end up in a square next to another crossed checker. A checker that has reached the end line
         ("Kings row") turns into a queen, which is given additional powers - it can walk back and
         forth one square at a time (also depending on the set rules of the game). \n\n A checker
         can also turn into a queen during crossing, if it is on the end line during one of the crossing stages.</string>
